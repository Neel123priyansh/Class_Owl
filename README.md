# 🦉 ClassOwl – AI‑Powered Classroom Assistant

ClassOwl is an intelligent classroom companion built using **Raspberry Pi + Local LLM (Ollama)** that listens to real classroom teaching, converts it into simplified multilingual notes, and automatically sends them to students via **WhatsApp**. The system also includes an AI chatbot that answers doubts based on captured audio and classroom content.

## 🦉 OLED Display Interaction Behavior

The ClassOwl includes a small OLED display that behaves like an animated owl to provide visual feedback in real-time.

### 🟢 Active Recording / Processing Mode

* The owl **eyes remain open and blinking**.
* A small mic or camera icon appears to indicate **live capture**.
* Status text like:

  * `Listening...`
  * `Analyzing...`
  * `Summarizing lesson...`
![alt text](https://github.com/Neel123priyansh/Class_Owl/blob/main/img/IMG-20250919-WA0021.jpg/?raw=true)

### 🟡 Idle Mode

* The owl's eyes **half-close**, resembling a resting state.
* A subtle **breathing animation** keeps it visually alive.
* Text displayed: `Standby...`

### 🔴 Sleep Mode

* Eyes are **fully closed**.
* No animations, only minimal energy usage.
* Wakes automatically when audio or activity is detected.

This makes the device more engaging, friendly for kids, and clearly indicates system state without needing a phone or laptop.
